# My python
This repository will have all my python codes
Here is the brief introduction of different part:

1. [assignment 1](https://github.com/RyanYin04/python/tree/master/assignment-1-RyanYin04/hw1.ipynb):
  This part is aiming at basic syntax in python and the basic slicing operation in pandas.
 
 
2. [assignment 2](https://github.com/RyanYin04/python/blob/master/assignment-2-RyanYin04/hw2.ipynb):
  This part is more about advanced usage of pandas including tidying data, concatenating, stacking, etc. 
  
3. [assignment 3](https://github.com/RyanYin04/python/blob/master/assignment-3-RyanYin04/hw3.ipynb):
  This part still works with pandas, but to get the data, API is used in this project.
  
4. [assingment 4](https://github.com/RyanYin04/python/blob/master/assignment-4-RyanYin04/hw4.ipynb):
  The basic tool of this project is pandas. Different from *assignment 3*, the way to get data is web scraping.
